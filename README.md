# TMEvaluationPlatform 
This repository contains a web-based evaluation platform that was designed
and implemented to provide an easy way of annotating data and gathering statistics
about the quality of the results obtained with the entity-based topic modeling pipeline that is avaiable for download here: https://github.com/anlausch/TMELPipeline.

In addition to the platform itself, the project folder contains a gold standard on three different datasets that was obtained thanks to the effort of three human annotators (annotations.zip).

Installation instructions:
- install MySQL
- install Node.js
- run the following command in the project folder: 
	npm install
- change database information in DBWrapper according to your needs

  npm start
